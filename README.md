# Data Structures by Gabriele Boccarusso

This repository contains data structures from scratch mostly in `C++`, in the future the repo will be organized for data structure and when completed will be available data structures from scratch in:
* `C++`
* `JavaScript`
* `Python`
* `C#`
* `Java`

## Notes
As IDE I am using [replit](https://replit.com), where i have to  change the `run` button everytime I want to try a data structure in a different language. To configure the run button:
* Python: `python <name>.py`
* C++: `g++ <name>.cpp ; ./a.out`
* JavaScript: `node <name>.js`

## Quick Documentation

### Arrays

In everyone of the dedicated folder there is a sub-folder named "arrays" with inside:
* Implementation of the static array from scratch
* Reversing of a string (an array of characters)
* Implementation of the dynamic array from scratch

Currently available in:
- [X] C++
  - [X] Reversing of a string
  - [X] Static array
  - [X] Dynamic array
- [X] Python
  - [X] Reversing of a string
  - [X] Static array
  - [X] Dynamic array
- [ ] JavaScript
  - [ ] Reversing of a string
  - [ ] Static array
  - [ ] Dynamic array

  Note: almost all of the methods for the dynamic arrays are not present because they would be just a copy and paste of the methods for the static one

### Hash tables
In everyone of the dedicated folder there is a sub-folder named "hash_tables" with inside:
* Implementation of the hash table from scratch
* first recurring character 

Currently available in:
- [X] C++
  - [X] hash table
  - [X] first recurring character
- [ ] Python
  - [ ] hash table
  - [ ] first recurring character
- [ ] JavaScript
  - [ ] hash table
  - [ ] first recurring character

### Linked lists
In everyone of the dedicated folder there is a sub-folder named "Linked_lists" with inside:
* singly linked list
* doubly linked list

Currently available in:
- [X] C++

### Stacks
In everyone of the dedicated folder there is a sub-folder named "stacks" with inside:
* linked stacks (a stack Implemented with pointers)
* static stacks (a stack Implemented with an array)
* dynamic stacks (a stack Implemented with an array that double its size when at size limit)

### Queues
In everyone of the dedicated folder there is a sub-folder named "queues" with inside:
* linked queue(a queue Implemented with pointers)
* static queue (a queue Implemented with an array)
* dynamic queue (a queue Implemented with an array that double its size when at size limit)
