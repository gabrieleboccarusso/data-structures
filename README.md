# Data Structures by Gabriele Boccarusso

This repository contains data structures from scratch in `python`, `C++` and `JavaScript` organized in their dedicated folders.

## Notes

As IDE I am using [replit](https://replit.com), where i have to  change the `run` button everytime I want to try a data structure in a different language. To configure the run button:
* Python: `python <name>.py`
* C++: `g++ <name>.cpp ; ./a.out`
* JavaScript: `node <name>.js`
