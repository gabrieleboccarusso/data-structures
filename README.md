# Data Structures by Gabriele Boccarusso

This repository contains data structures from scratch in `python`, `C++` and `JavaScript` organized in their dedicated folders.

## Notes

As IDE I am using [replit](https://replit.com), where i have to  change the `run` button everytime I want to try a data structure in a different language. To configure the run button:
* Python: `python <name>.py`
* C++: `g++ <name>.cpp ; ./a.out`
* JavaScript: `node <name>.js`

### Arrays

In everyone of the dedicated folder there is a sub-folder named "arrays" with inside:
* Implementation of the static array from scratch
* Reversing of a string (an array of characters)
* Implementation of the dynamic array from scratch

Currently available in:
- [X] C++
  - [X] Reversing of a string
  - [X] Static array
  - [X] Dynamic array
- [X] Python
  - [X] Reversing of a string
  - [X] Static array
  - [X] Dynamic array
- [ ] JavaScript
  - [ ] Reversing of a string
  - [ ] Static array
  - [ ] Dynamic array

  Note: almost all of the methods for the dynamic arrays are not present because they would be just a copy and paste of the methods for the static one
